To Do List

Plan for release 2.1
Release date: December 10, 2013

New features:
Improvement of math input (probably sw keyboard)

Test automation:
Initial version of Junit test is implemented. I want to add more tests.
For GUI testing, I tried Robotium, but it was very unreliable.
I am trying Expresso from Google. It does not support webview, though.

Code Refactoring:
MaximaOnAndroidActivity.java gets very messy. Code placement should be fixed.
Also, logic and UI should be separted as far as possible to make more 
unit test possible.
ManualActivity and HTMLActivity should be refined to be testable with
current Espresso implementation.
