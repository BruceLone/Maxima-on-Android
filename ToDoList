To Do List

Plan for release 2.1
Release date: December 10, 2013

New features:
Improvement of math input (probably sw keyboard)
test automation
  Initial version of Junit test is implemented. I want to add more tests.
  For GUI testing, I tried Robotium, but it was very unreliable.
  I am trying Expresso from Google. It does not webview, though.
